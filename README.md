# Git and GitHub in 1 hour

This lesson combines and modifies content from the [Software Carpentry Version Control with Git lesson](https://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/), the [Carpentries Incubator Version Control with Git lesson](https://carpentries-incubator.github.io/git-novice-branch-pr/) that incorporates branches and PRs, and the [Library Carpentry Introduction to Git lesson](https://librarycarpentry.github.io/lc-git/).

The actual delivered content is designed to be taught in 1 hour, but requires learners to complete set-up and installation steps prior to the workshop, as well as a recommended set of GitHub Skills courses.
